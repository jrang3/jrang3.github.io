    <p class="lead">Developing a VR-based simulation in Unreal Engine that teaches archaeological fieldwork skills through immersive, research-aligned educational gameplay</p>

    <hr class="my-4">
    <h4>üîç Motivation & Impact</h4>
    <p>
        Traditional archaeological fieldwork is expensive and logistically challenging, often costing students between $500 and $5,000. As part of Stu/dio ‚Äî the first student-led game development studio at UIUC ‚Äî I'm collaborating with a multidisciplinary team to develop a VR-based simulation that provides a hands-on alternative. This immersive experience trains students in excavation, mapping, and analysis skills in a virtual environment, helping reduce cost barriers and make archaeology more accessible.
    </p>


    <h4>üõ† My Contributions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing core gameplay mechanics in Unreal Engine using C++, including excavation tools, artifact interactions, and in-game data logging</li>
        <li>Implementing level scripting to guide users through structured educational tasks such as site mapping and the use of ground-penetrating radar</li>
        <li>Collaborating with designers and domain experts to create immersive, research-aligned content that supports academic learning goals</li>
        <li>Contributing to a historically inspired recreation of a 1930s North American cave site featuring over 110 virtual artifacts</li> <!-- new bullet -->
