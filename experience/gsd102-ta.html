    <p>
      As a Teaching Assistant for GSD 102: Intro to the Videogame Industry, I led weekly discussion sections where students critically analyzed readings about the game development world. I prepared open-ended questions to drive group conversation, foster critical thinking, and deepen understanding of themes such as career pathways, development pipelines, market challenges, and ethics in the video game industry.

    <p>
      I also mentored student teams as they created non-digital board games aligned with course objectives. This involved guiding them to balance gameplay elements like randomness and meaningful choice, align mechanics with real-world industry dynamics, and stay within project constraints such as limited class time and materials. The project helped students understand game production challenges while encouraging creativity and collaboration.
