    <p class="lead">
      Built a complete 3D action-collection game in Unreal Engine 5, featuring a multi-island environment, dynamic enemy behavior, environmental hazards, and over 60 collectibles. Designed all gameplay systems, mechanics, and AI to create a balanced and engaging player experience.

    <h4>üîç Overview</h4>
    <p>
        I developed a full 3D action-collection game in Unreal Engine 5, where players explore three interconnected islands and aim to collect at least 40 out of 60+ scattered collectibles to win. The game combines exploration, platforming, combat, and hazard avoidance into a cohesive and progressively challenging experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main island offers a more spacious layout, allowing players to dodge projectiles and avoid enemies with ease. In contrast, the two smaller islands feature tighter, high-pressure environments with roaming enemies, dense structures, and projectile hazards that demand precise movement and quick decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        I implemented core gameplay systems including a health bar, collectible tracking, level completion logic, enemy pursuit AI, and explosive landmine interactions. To raise the stakes, I placed mortars, pursuer enemies, and landmines near valuable collectibles, while buildings and narrow terrain increased environmental difficulty. Every aspect‚Äîfrom mechanics to level flow‚Äîwas designed and scripted to provide a satisfying balance of challenge and accessibility.
    </p>
